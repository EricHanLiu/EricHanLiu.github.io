# What is this?
This repository is a blog website I created to practice and develop my backend and frontend web design abilities.

It was made with the help of the Codeigniter framework.

##Difficulties
For one, I have not yet found a way to host codeigniter projects on GitHub Pages, so as of now I can only host the website locally using MAMP. 

##Skills
Working on this project has drastically increased my knowledge of PHP, MYSQL, Bootstrap, and JQuery (essentially from nothing).

Big shoutout to my mentor Adnane for the help with learning PHP etc.
